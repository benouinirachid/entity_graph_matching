* I want to use pymupdf to extract the words and bbox in a PDF files 
And I want to create a dictionary, in which each word is linked with its nearest neighbors in terms of bbox based on euclidean distance
* Now I want to compare two documents based on the 'word_neighbors' can you give me any way to do it 

output:
Comparing two documents based on their "word_neighbors" structures, where each word is linked with its nearest neighbors in terms of bounding box (bbox) distances, presents an interesting challenge. It requires a method to quantify the similarity between the spatial distributions of words and their relations within the documents. Here are several approaches you could consider for this comparison:

1. Graph-Based Similarity
Given that the "word_neighbors" structure essentially forms a graph with words as nodes and their nearest neighbor relations as edges, one way to compare documents is by using graph similarity metrics.

Graph Edit Distance (GED): Calculate the minimum number of operations (addition, deletion, substitution of nodes or edges) required to transform one graph into the other. A lower GED indicates higher similarity.
Node and Edge Overlap: Compute the overlap in nodes (words) and edges (neighbor relations) between the two graphs. This can be normalized by the total number of nodes and edges to obtain a similarity score.
2. Feature Vector Comparison
Transform the "word_neighbors" structure of each document into a feature vector and then use vector similarity measures.

Vector Encoding: For each document, create a high-dimensional vector where each dimension corresponds to a specific word-neighbor pair, and the value could represent the frequency or presence of that pair in the document.
Cosine Similarity: Compute the cosine similarity between the feature vectors of the two documents. Higher values indicate greater similarity.
3. Clustering-Based Approach
Use clustering algorithms to group similar words based on their spatial relationships and then compare the resulting cluster structures.

Cluster the Words: Use algorithms like K-means or DBSCAN on the coordinates of the words to cluster them based on their spatial proximity in each document.
Compare Clusters: Develop metrics to compare the resulting clusters between documents, such as the number of clusters, average distance between clusters, or the distribution of words in clusters.
4. Statistical Distribution Comparison
Compare the statistical distributions of distances between neighboring words in the documents.

Distance Distribution: Calculate the distribution of Euclidean distances between each word and its nearest neighbors in both documents.
Statistical Tests: Use statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) to compare the distributions of distances. A smaller p-value would indicate that the distributions are significantly different.
Implementation Tips:
Preprocessing: Ensure that both documents are preprocessed similarly (e.g., text normalization) before comparison.
Performance Considerations: Some of these methods, especially graph edit distance, can be computationally intensive. It may be beneficial to use approximations or heuristics for larger documents.
Interpretation of Results: The choice of comparison method should be guided by the nature of the documents and the specific aspects of the "word_neighbors" structure that are most relevant to your analysis.
Each of these methods offers a different perspective on document similarity, focusing on the spatial relationships between words. The best approach depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.
